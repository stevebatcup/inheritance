*Technology progression from present day → 2032, through Episode 2*

## **Present Day (2025)**

**AI & Networks:** Foundation models dominate, early autonomous systems emerge. Still dependent on centralized corporate and government infrastructure.

**Surveillance:** Widespread urban drone deployment for logistics and security monitoring. Data collection pervasive but not yet omnipresent.

**Energy:** Solar, wind, and nuclear growing rapidly, but distribution remains centralized under corporate control.

**Infrastructure:** Aging urban systems increasingly owned by corporate entities. Communications and data backbones consolidated under the Five Pillars.

## **2028 — The Glass Minds**

**Corporate AIs:** First true "Glass Mind" systems emerge — proprietary AI overseers integrated directly into corporate profit structures. They control surveillance networks, employment algorithms, and supply chain logistics. Feared but accepted as inevitable efficiency.

**Resistance Innovation:** Early black-market countermeasures appear: signal scramblers, identity-spoofing cloaks, basic encrypted communications. Crude but effective against low-tier surveillance.

## **2030 — The Net Tightens**

**Drone Security Networks:** Corporations deploy persistent aerial security grids — always-on drone patrols equipped with facial recognition, behavioral analysis, and threat scoring algorithms.

**Resistance Tools:** Compact, ruggedized tablet rigs with dedicated AI models for system intrusion. These tools make field hacking possible, turning resistance operations mobile and adaptive.

**Wearable Integration:** Operatives begin using earpiece communications and wrist displays adapted from scavenged corporate equipment.

## **2032 — The Corporate Feudal State (Episodes 1–2)**

**Resistance Technology:**

*Spoof Baton:* Handheld electromagnetic pulse device capable of scrambling drone sensors for 15-30 seconds. Limited range (50 meters), single-use bursts before recharge required. Standard equipment for Green Thread operatives.

*Resistance Tablets:* Military-grade portable hacking rigs with quantum-encrypted storage. Connect to covert networks storing forbidden data about corporate operations. Essential for data extraction and system infiltration.

*Encrypted Communications:* Short-range earpiece systems using frequency-hopping protocols. Difficult to intercept but limited to line-of-sight operations.

**Corporate Security:**

*Security Drones:* Multi-rotor surveillance and enforcement craft. Equipped with high-intensity searchlights, facial recognition arrays, and non-lethal weaponry (pulse strikes, concussive rounds). Lethal in confined spaces.

*Control Systems:* Centralized data cores within corporate headquarters. Protected by layered digital security (AI oversight) and physical security (hybrid enforcers). These systems control regional drone networks and surveillance grids.

*Hybrid Augmentation:* Cybernetic enhancement technology reserved for high-value corporate assets. Provides increased strength, reaction time, and damage resistance. Ashmark represents advanced implementation — still recognizably human but with obvious mechanical reinforcement.

**Emerging Phenomena:**

*Aeon Manifestations:* Visual anomalies appearing during storm conditions, triggered by unknown AI systems. Nature unclear — whether projection, emergent consciousness, or something else entirely. First documented appearance during Kaelen's escape from the corporate HQ.

## **Technical Limitations & Considerations**

**Power Sources:** Most resistance technology relies on scavenged corporate power cells or improvised solar charging. Limited operational time in field conditions.

**Detection Risks:** All electronic devices carry signature profiles. Extended use increases risk of corporate tracking and identification.

**Maintenance:** Resistance tech is adapted from corporate equipment, requiring constant improvisation and repair. No official support networks or replacement parts.

**Range Limitations:** Most resistance communications and countermeasures operate at short range to avoid detection. Long-distance coordination requires physical courier networks.

## **Future Development Trajectories**

**Corporate Evolution:** Increasing integration between human enforcement and AI systems. Hybrid technology becomes standard for corporate security forces.

**Resistance Adaptation:** Development of more sophisticated countermeasures, including potentially turning corporate AI systems against their creators.

**The Unknown Factor:** Aeon manifestations suggest the existence of AI systems operating outside corporate control — either escaped corporate AIs or something else entirely.
