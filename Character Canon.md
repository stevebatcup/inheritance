## **Kaelen — The Inheritor**

**Age (Ep1):** Mid-20s  
**Role:** Resistance courier and data specialist, central protagonist  
**Appearance:** Athletic build, blonde hair (longer, often loose), storm gray-green cloak fastened at the collar, nose ring, subtle wearable tech integration. Grungy but striking — practical gear worn with unconscious grace  
**Traits:** Determined, resourceful, immune to corporate propaganda. Deeply empathetic but hardened by loss. Technical skills honed through necessity  
**Arc (Ep1–2):** Witnesses Dara's capture and Brynn's sacrifice during the HQ infiltration. Inherits leadership of a decimated cell, the burden of forbidden data, and the responsibility to rescue her captured commander. Isolated but driven — carrying both grief and purpose

## **Dara — The Captured Leader**

**Age:** Early 30s  
**Role:** Resistance cell commander, strategic coordinator, tactical intelligence  
**Appearance:** Middle Eastern descent, sharp features, cropped dark hair, compact but authoritative build. Practical tactical gear prioritizing mobility — tablet rig, lightweight harness, cloak often open for quick equipment access  
**Traits:** Commands through competence rather than rank. Tech-savvy with strategic thinking. Protective of her team, decisive under pressure  
**Arc (Ep1–2):** Leads the HQ infiltration mission. Captured (not killed) after being wounded during the rooftop drone confrontation. Her imprisonment establishes the primary motivation for future rescue operations and creates the cell's leadership vacuum that Kaelen must fill

**Traits:** Steady sergeant energy to Dara's leadership. Naturally protective, pragmatic, carries the weight of sacrifice. The reliable backbone who puts mission and team survival above self  
**Arc (Ep1–2):** After Dara's capture, becomes Kaelen's primary protector during the control room infiltration. Dies completing the data upload override — his sacrifice buying the seconds needed for mission success. His death resonates as the loss of the cell's foundation, establishing him as the resistance's martyred hero
