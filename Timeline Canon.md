## **Episode 1: Entry Point (2032-H1)**

**Preparation Half (Preparation for a Battle):**  
Storm-lit safehouse ritual. Kaelen, Brynn, and Dara perform the methodical dance of gear preparation: cloaks fastened with practiced precision, equipment checked and distributed, final silent acknowledgments of trust. The calm before action, underscored by steady orchestral counterpoint that builds toward inevitable violence.

**Approach Half (Trouble Approaches):**  
The cell infiltrates corporate HQ through storm-damaged streets and forgotten infrastructure. Surveillance sweeps the urban landscape as tension escalates through careful movement and near-misses. The approach becomes pursuit when Dara is spotted during the final approach — wounded by security fire but captured alive rather than killed. Kaelen and Brynn push forward into the facility, shaken but mission-focused.

## **Episode 2: The Escape Clause (2032-H2)**

**Enemy Half (Large/Powerful Enemy):**  
Inside the corporate control room, Kaelen initiates the critical data upload while Brynn confronts Ashmark — the imposing cybernetic enforcer representing corporate power made flesh. The confrontation is brutal and methodical, weighted with the knowledge that only one will survive. Brynn sacrifices himself to buy the precious seconds needed for Kaelen to complete the system override, temporarily paralyzing Ashmark but paying with his life.

**Escape Half (Resolution):**  
Kaelen flees through storm-swept streets, carrying the extracted data and the weight of loss. Corporate security converges as the weather intensifies. In the chaos of wind and rain, the mysterious phenomenon Aeon manifests in the storm clouds — vast, luminous, ambiguous in intention. Kaelen pauses in awestruck recognition, whispering: *"Why are you letting me go?"* The apparition fades as mysteriously as it appeared, and she vanishes into the urban weather, alone but carrying hope.

## **Episode 2A: The Weight of Command (2032-H2+7 days)**

**Preparation Half (Preparation for a Mission):**  
One week after the devastating HQ infiltration, Kaelen struggles with inherited leadership of the decimated cell. She must balance immediate survival needs with long-term resistance operations, all while processing the forbidden data extracted at such terrible cost. The preparation becomes both practical (securing new safe locations, establishing communication with other cells) and psychological (accepting the burden of command that Dara once carried).

**Approach Half (Planning the Impossible):**  
Intelligence gathering reveals Dara's location within a corporate detention facility. Kaelen begins the delicate work of planning a rescue operation that seems beyond her capabilities. Initial reconnaissance, resource assessment, and tentative outreach to other Green Thread cells. The approach is not physical movement but the mounting tension of an impossible decision: attempt a rescue that could destroy what remains of the resistance, or abandon Dara to save the larger cause.

## **Orchestral Architecture Notes**

**Episode 1:** Preparation → Approach (builds toward Episode 2)  
**Episode 2:** Enemy → Escape (completes the first story arc)  
**Episode 2A:** Preparation → Approach (sets up the rescue arc)

Each half-episode runs approximately 90 seconds to 2 minutes, allowing for detailed orchestral development while maintaining narrative momentum. The musical themes established in Episodes 1-2 return in 2A but transformed by loss and the weight of new responsibility.
