## **Episode 1: The Escape Clause (2032-H2)**

**A: Enemy Half (Large/Powerful Enemy):**  
Inside the corporate control room, Kaelen initiates the critical data upload while Brynn confronts Ashmark — the imposing cybernetic enforcer representing corporate power made flesh. The confrontation is brutal and methodical, weighted with the knowledge that only one will survive. Brynn sacrifices himself to buy the precious seconds needed for Kaelen to complete the system override, temporarily paralyzing Ashmark but paying with his life.

**B: Escape Half (Resolution):**  
Kaelen flees through storm-swept streets, carrying the extracted data and the weight of loss. Corporate security converges as the weather intensifies. In the chaos of wind and rain, the mysterious phenomenon Aeon manifests in the storm clouds — vast, luminous, ambiguous in intention. Kaelen pauses in awestruck recognition, whispering: *"Why are you letting me go?"* The apparition fades as mysteriously as it appeared, and she vanishes into the urban weather, alone but carrying hope.
